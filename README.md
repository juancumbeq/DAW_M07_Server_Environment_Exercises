# Server Side Environment - Exercises

Here you can find some exercises I made during my Certificate of Higher Education (HNC). We started from scratch, learning the PHP fundamentals and how to integrate it with other technologies like HTML5 to create forms and SQL to request data from a database.

## Example 1: Links_Inside_PHP

HTML5 allows us to insert PHP tags inside a web page's body. These tags contain executable PHP code. In this case, we are using the `echo()` function to print a `<a href="#">` tag inside the HTML body, creating a reference to another `.php` file.

#### *Seen methods*
- `echo()`
<br><br>

## Example 2: Variables
In PHP, like many other languages such as JavaScript, it is not necessary to specify the data type when allocating a variable. A remarkable difference is that every variable is prefixed with the symbol `$`. To define and initialize a constant, we use the function `define("MY_CONSTANT", value)`. This allows us to create a constant with a fixed value that cannot be changed throughout the script's execution.

#### *Seen methods*
- `define()`
- `(int)($variable)`
- `round()`
<br><br>

## Example 3: Insert PHP code in a HTML block


#### *Seen methods*
- `echo()`
<br><br>


## Example 4: Insert Date


#### *Seen methosds*
- `time()`
- `date()`
- `getdate()`
- `echo()`
